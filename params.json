More complex methods of combination will be built later. \r\n\r\n```lisp\r\n    (define-compositional-nlg jack () \"jack\")\r\n\r\n    (define-compositional-nlg mary () \"mary\")\r\n\r\n    (define-compositional-nlg loves (x y) x \" loves \" y)\r\n\r\n    (nlg (parse '(loves jack mary))) ==> \r\n\r\n     \"JACK LOVES MARY  \"\r\n\r\n    (nlg (parse '(perceives jack t1 (loves jack mary)))) ==> \r\n\r\n    \"AGENT JACK  PERCEIVES THAT JACK LOVES MARY   AT MOMENT T1  \"\r\n\r\n```","name":"Rlcnl","tagline":"RAIR Lab's Logically Controlled Natural Language"}
